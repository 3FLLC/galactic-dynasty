The last line is only needed if running the game interbbs. This is the process needed
to run the inbound and outbound processing for game packets. If your game is only a 
local run, this line can be omitted.

I have found that having the script file located in the GalacticDynasty directory is 
the easiest way to run it. I had issues with trying to locate the file in other
locations.

Please note the case of both the commands in the script file, and the data field within
Mystic. Linux is case sensitive, and if the case is not correct, it will not work.
Trust me. :)
