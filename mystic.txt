Here is what I have setup running Mystic under Windows.

(D3) Exec DOOR32 program
c:\bbs\doors\gdyn\start.bat %P\door32.sys %3 %0

%P - passes the node temporary directory for dropfiles
%3 - passes the node number
%0 - passes the socket handle on Windows (I added this due to an issue)

The batch file that I'm using is simply:

c:
cd \bbs\doors\gdyn\
galacticdynasty.exe -D %1 -N %2 -SOCKET %3   

Hope this helps some people out a bit.
